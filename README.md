# LocalWeatherApp-Full-Stack
A full-stack application that allows user to get hourly forecast weather data based on the given location


The Application includes both front end and back. The front-end is built by ReactJS and the backend uses Spring Boot. 

The backend will retrieve the real weather data of current date from OpenWeather API. 

To test this application, **you will need to apply personal API keys and replace the pesodu key in the backend**.
